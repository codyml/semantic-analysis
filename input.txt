Seven AM, waking up in the morning, gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs.  Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal, seein' everything, the time is goin'.
Tickin' on and on, everybody's rushin', gotta get down to the bus stop.
Gotta catch my bus, I see my friends!
Kicking it in the front seat, sitting in the back seat.
Gotta make my mind up; which seat can I take?

It's Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday.
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend!
Friday, Friday,
gettin' down on Friday,
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend!

Partyin', partyin' (Yeah)
Partyin', partyin' (Yeah)
Fun, fun, fun, fun,
lookin' forward to the weekend!

Seven forty-five, we're drivin' on the highway,
cruisin' so fast, I want time to fly!
Fun, fun, think about fun,
you know what it is.
I got this, you got this,
my friend is by my right, ay!
I got this, you got this,
now you know it.
Kicking it in the front seat,
sitting' in the back seat,
gotta make my mind up,
which seat can I take?

It's Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday.
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend!
Friday, Friday.

Yesterday was Thursday;
Today is Friday!
We, we, we so excited! We so excited,
we gonna have a ball today.
Tomorrow is Saturday, and Sunday comes afterwards.
I don't want this weekend to end!

R.B., Rebecca Black!
So chillin' in the front seat, in the front seat,
in the back seat, in the back seat.
I'm drivin', cruisin', yeah, yeah.
Fast lanes, switchin' lanes,
wit' a car up on my side.  (Woo!)
(Come on!) Passing by is a school bus in front of me:
makes tick tock, tick tock, wanna scream!
Check my time, it's Friday, it's a weekend,
we gonna have fun, c'mon, c'mon y'all!

It's Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday.
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend!

Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend!
